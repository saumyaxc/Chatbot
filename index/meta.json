We provide direct answers and point back\nto the daily habits that reliably improve life with pets.\n\n## Daily Care Checklist\n\n- Fresh water is available at all times. Refill bowls twice daily and wash them with soap every 1–2 days to prevent biofilm.\n- Feed measured meals appropriate for age and size. Stick to a consistent schedule (e.g., 7am and 6pm) to regulate digestion and behavior.\n- Provide at least 15 minutes of interactive play or training in the morning and evening. Rotate toys to keep novelty high.\n- Offer elimination opportunities: dogs out every 4–6 hours; scooping cat litter daily and refreshing 1–2 inches of litter as needed.\n- Perform a quick 30‑second health scan: clear eyes, clean ears, normal gait, normal appetite, and typical energy level.\n- Log anything unusual (coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, limping, changes in thirst), and contact a vet if signs persist beyond 24 hours.\n\n## Exercise and Play Guidelines\n\n- Toy/small breed dogs: 30–60 minutes daily split into short sessions; avoid long-impact runs.\n- Sporting/herding dogs (Border Collie, Lab): 90–120 minutes daily including aero"}, {"source": "20_New_Owner_FAQ_and_Myth_Busting.md", "text": "se and Play Guidelines\n\n- Toy/small breed dogs: 30–60 minutes daily split into short sessions; avoid long-impact runs.\n- Sporting/herding dogs (Border Collie, Lab): 90–120 minutes daily including aerobic and problem‑solving work.\n- Giant breeds (Great Dane): moderate, low‑impact walks; avoid repetitive jumping especially before 18 months.\n- Indoor cats: schedule 2–3 play bursts/day (5–10 minutes each) using wand toys; end with a small food reward.\n\n## Grooming by Coat Type\n\n- Short‑coat dogs (Beagles, Boxers) benefit from weekly rubber‑brush sessions; bath every 6–8 weeks or when dirty.\n- Double‑coat dogs (Golden Retrievers, Huskies) shed seasonally; use undercoat rakes 2–3×/week and avoid shaving.\n- Curly/wool coats (Poodles, Doodles) mat quickly; line‑brush every 1–2 days and schedule grooming every 4–6 weeks.\n- Long‑hair cats (Maine Coon, Persian) need daily combing to prevent mats; consider sanitary trims if needed.\n- Short‑hair cats often self‑maintain, but weekly grooming reduces shedding and hairballs; introduce grooming early.\n\n## Preventive Veterinary Care\n\n- Puppies and kittens: core vaccines every 3–4 weeks until 16 weeks; deworming schedule per vet; start parasite preve"}, {"source": "20_New_Owner_FAQ_and_Myth_Busting.md", "text": " shedding and hairballs; introduce grooming early.\n\n## Preventive Veterinary Care\n\n- Puppies and kittens: core vaccines every 3–4 weeks until 16 weeks; deworming schedule per vet; start parasite prevention.\n- Adults: annual wellness exam, vaccine boosters per protocol, year‑round heartworm and flea/tick prevention.\n- Seniors (7+ dogs; 10+ cats): semiannual exams, annual bloodwork and urinalysis; monitor weight, mobility, and cognition.\n- Dental care: daily brushing is gold standard; otherwise dental diets, chews, and professional cleanings per vet advice.\n\n## Typical Costs and Budgeting\n\n- Initial costs: adoption fees or breeder deposits, spay/neuter, microchip, first exams, crate/carrier, bowls, bed, litter box, leash/harness.\n- Monthly: food, litter, parasite prevention, toys, training classes, insurance premiums, grooming for high‑maintenance coats.\n- Annual/variable: vaccines, dental cleaning, boarding, sitters, unexpected vet visits.

Introduce changes gradually to avoid box aversion.\n- Avoid covered boxes if a cat seems hesitant; ensure easy access for seniors by using low‑entry boxes.\n- Keep boxes away from noisy appliances and far from food/water stations to reduce stress.\n\n## Toxic Foods and Plants to Avoid\n\n- Xylitol (in sugar‑free gum, candies, and some peanut butters) can cause life‑threatening hypoglycemia in dogs.\n- Grapes and raisins may lead to acute kidney failure in dogs; the toxic dose is unpred"}, {"source": "20_New_Owner_FAQ_and_Myth_Busting.md", "text": "- Xylitol (in sugar‑free gum, candies, and some peanut butters) can cause life‑threatening hypoglycemia in dogs.\n- Grapes and raisins may lead to acute kidney failure in dogs; the toxic dose is unpredictable—avoid entirely.\n- Onions, garlic, chives, and leeks can damage red blood cells (Heinz body anemia), particularly in cats.\n- Chocolate and cocoa contain theobromine; dark chocolate poses the highest risk.
